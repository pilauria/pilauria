# Hi there, I'm Pietro ðŸ‘‹
I'm a full-stack developer, currently in Spain but looking for opportunities around the world! <br/> <br/>
After many years working in the military and retail industry, I decided that I wanted to use my skills as a programmer to bring exciting ideas to life and to work on awesome inspiring projects.

I have recently completed the Ironhack bootcamp, where I studied full-stack Javascript development, specifically the MERN stack: MongoDB, Express, React, Node.
